## chapter

A chapter, section, or a range of pages of a book is stored numerically in ``chapter``.
This BibTeX-field is used for ``inbook`` and ``incollection``. The former is mandatory.
``chapter`` is not supported in the entry-type ``book`` because for the latter, the whole book is intended to be cited.
