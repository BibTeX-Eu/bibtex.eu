# BibTeX article type

Scientific articles from a journal or magazine are usually stored with the article type in the .bib file. Required fields are author, title, journal, year, and volume. Number, pages, month, doi, annotation, and key are optional fields.

```latex
@article{citationKey,
	title        = {...},
	author       = {...},
	year         = {...},
	journal      = {...}
}
```
