# How do I create a .BIB file to manage my BibTeX references?

If you're looking for a way to manage your `BibTeX` references, you may be wondering how to create a `.BIB file`. In this article, we'll show you how to do it! We'll also provide some tips on how to use ".BIB" files effectively.

## Creating a bib file by hand

Creating a `.BIB file` is actually quite simple. All you need to do is create a text file with the `.bib` extension. You can then add your BibTeX references to this file, one per line. For example:


```latex
@article{smith201X,
	title        = {An interesting article},
	author       = {John Smith},
	year         = {201X},
	journal      = {Journal of Interesting Articles}
}
```



Once you have your `.BIB file` created, you can then use it in your LaTeX documents by specifying the `\bibliography{filename}` command. For example:


```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{natbib}

\begin{document}

...

\bibliography{filename}

\end{document}
```

That's all there is to it! Creating a `.BIB file` is a simple way to manage your BibTeX references. Be sure to check out our other articles on BibTeX for more tips and tricks!


## Using Reference management software

Many use reference management software to collect literature and format citations and bibliographies in style. Or they use simple citation tools or software to create citations. If you use something like this and are working with BibTeX for the first time because the journal requires it or because your team works with LaTeX, e.g., with Overleaf, you can be sure that there is usually an export function that creates a bib file for you. Here are a few good examples, the first two of which were built entirely on BibTeX by the developers.
